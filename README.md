# Inumaki

Programming language made for [Hack Club's langjam](https://langjam.hackclub.com) based off the speech of the Jujutsu Kaisen character [Toge Inumaki](https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Toge_Inumaki). Though the original is of course Japanese, I'll be using the English translations of his vocabulary for the sake of my own sanity.

# Vocabulary
